# 🔷 Hasse Diagram Visualizer

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7%2B-blue)

A Python tool to visualize the **Hasse diagram** of a partially ordered set (poset). This tool performs a transitive reduction, checks for structural validity, and draws a clean, level-based diagram using `networkx` and `matplotlib`.

## 📚 What Is a Hasse Diagram?

A **Hasse diagram** is a simplified drawing of a partially ordered set (poset), where:

- Only the **essential order relations** are shown (i.e., transitive and reflexive relations are omitted).
- Edges are drawn **upward** to represent the partial order.
- The diagram is **layered**, showing elements by level of dependency.

## ✨ Features

- Automatically performs **transitive reduction** to eliminate redundant relations  
- Validates that the input is a **valid poset** according to the definition
- Dynamically adjusts **node size** and **layout** based on input size  
- Supports **custom node colors** (classic colors like `red`, `green`, `blue`, etc.)  
- Clean, level-based layout using `matplotlib` and `networkx`

## 📦 Installation

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install matplotlib networkx
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

Import the package

```bash
from hasse_diagram import display_hasse_diagram
```

Define your poset (reflexive pairs are optional)

```bash
poset = [
    (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 10), (1, 12), (1, 15), (1, 20), (1, 30), (1, 60),
    (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (2, 10), (2, 12), (2, 20), (2, 30), (2, 60),
    (3, 3), (3, 6), (3, 12), (3, 15), (3, 30), (3, 60),
    (4, 4), (4, 12), (4, 20), (4, 60),
    (5, 5), (5, 10), (5, 15), (5, 20), (5, 30), (5, 60),
    (6, 6), (6, 12), (6, 30), (6, 60),
    (10, 10), (10, 20), (10, 30), (10, 60),
    (12, 12), (12, 60),
    (15, 15), (15, 30), (15, 60),
    (20, 20), (20, 60),
    (30, 30), (30, 60),
    (60, 60)
]
```

Set a title and node color, then display the diagram

```bash
display_hasse_diagram(poset, title="My Poset", node_color="skyblue")
```
